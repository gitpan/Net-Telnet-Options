  What's In It For You
  --------------------

   .  You're writing a telnet server (chat, mud) and want to know what size
      your clients terminals are, or want to turn off ECHOing for password prompts.

   .  You're writing a telnet client and just want to auto-respond to server
      enquiries about the size of you terminal.

   .  You'd like to implement telnet options for a server or client
      software, without having to worry about the internals

   .  You already have a socket or sockets over which you want to communicate.


  Archive Location
  ----------------

    .  In the CPAN directory: modules/by-module/Net/

    .  To find a CPAN site near you see http://cpan.perl.org/SITES.html


  Prerequisites
  -------------

    .  Perl Version 5.006 or later (tests require 5.8.x)

    .  No other modules are required that don't already come with a
       standard distribution of Perl.


  Documentation
  -------------

    User documentation in POD format is contained within the module
    source (i.e. the .pm file).  Installing using "make install"
    places this documentation in a man page in the perl library under
    the directory "man/man3".

    To nicely format the documentation for printing, you may use
    "groff" to convert to postscript.  Groff is available under
    the GNU General Public License (GPL) and is installed on most
    Linux machines.

        pod2man Net/Telnet/Options.pm | groff -man -Tps > Net::Telnet::Options.ps


  Installation
  ------------

    To install, cd to the directory containing the unpacked
    distribution and do one of the following:

    a.  Create a makefile by running Makefile.PL using the perl
        program into whose library you want to install and then run
        make three times:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

    b.  To install into a private library, for example your home
        directory:

            perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME/lib/perl
            make
            make test
            make pure_install

    c.  Alternatively, you can just copy or move Options.pm
        from the distribution into a directory named Net/Telnet/ in the Perl
        library.  You can then manually build the documentation using
        pod2man or pod2html.
